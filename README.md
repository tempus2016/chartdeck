> **2.0 adds the rest of the roadmap: parts of a total, distributions, comparisons, flows, hierarchies, and zoom, annotations and more on the line chart.** Ideas for what comes next are on the
> [roadmap board][roadmap].

![The seven Chartdeck styles in a light theme: classic bar, thin bar, segmented, tank, ring, needle and arc](images/preview-v1.png)

📖 **The documentation is in the [wiki][wiki]**, also published as a [searchable site][pages].
This page is the summary. What changed in each version is on the [releases page][releases].

## Why Chartdeck

- **Everything from the visual editor.** Pick entities, choose a style, set colour bands
  and limits without writing YAML. YAML still works, and the editor and YAML always agree.
- **One card, many styles.** Switching from a bar to a ring or a gauge is one setting. Colour
  bands, actions, names and limits carry across.
- **No chart library.** Every style is drawn by the card's own code, so it stays small, loads
  fast on wall tablets, and follows your Home Assistant theme.
- **Limits from anywhere.** Minimum, maximum and target can each be a number or another
  entity.

## Installation

Chartdeck is in the HACS default store:

1. Open HACS and search for *Chartdeck*.
2. Download it, then reload your browser.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=tempus2016&repository=chartdeck&category=lovelace)

To install by hand, save [chartdeck-card.js][latest-release] to `<config>/www/` and add
`/local/chartdeck-card.js` as a dashboard resource of type `module`. The
[Installation][wiki-installation] page has the detail.

## Getting started

Edit a dashboard, choose **Add card**, and search for **Chartdeck**. The editor walks you
through the rest. The [Quick start][wiki-quick-start] shows the same in pictures.

## Quick start

```yaml
type: custom:chartdeck-card
style: ring
entities:
  - sensor.cpu_usage
severity:
  - from: 0
    color: green
  - from: 80
    color: red
```

Every option is in the [wiki][wiki].

## Help and feedback

- Something not right? Check [Troubleshooting][wiki-troubleshooting], then
  [open an issue][issues].
- Want a chart type that is not here yet? Use the
  [New chart type][new-chart] form — the votes on those decide what comes next.
- Questions and dashboards to show off go in [Discussions][discussions].
