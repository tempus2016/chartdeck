/*
 * Derivative series (`transform: derivative` on an entity): a history chart draws how fast the
 * entity changes instead of its readings. Watts from an energy meter, °C per hour from a
 * thermometer, litres per minute from a water meter.
 *
 * Each reading after the first gives the rate over the time since the one before:
 * (v₁ − v₀) ÷ (t₁ − t₀), in the entity's unit per `transform_unit_time` (s, min, h or d; h by
 * default), drawn at the later reading as Home Assistant's derivative helper does. Then:
 *
 * - A meter that only counts up (state_class total_increasing) falling is a reset, not a negative
 *   rate: that step is dropped and the next one is measured from the new reading.
 * - The first reading after a gap, and the reading carried in from before the span (its real time
 *   is earlier than the left edge, so the time since it is unknown), start a new run: no rate.
 * - A series that held one value all span (history then has only the reading carried in to its
 *   start, so no step to measure) changed at a rate of 0: it is drawn at 0 from that reading to
 *   now. A series with no reading at all stays empty ("No readings").
 * - `transform_smoothing: n` averages each rate with the n − 1 before it in the same run.
 * - `transform_smoothing_time: 15min` (a number and s, min, h or d) averages over a trailing time
 *   window instead, each rate weighted by how much of the window it covers: for a meter that is
 *   how much it went up in the last 15 minutes, per unit time. It suits sensors that report at
 *   uneven intervals, where a count of readings is a different stretch of time each time. When
 *   both are set, the time window is used.
 *
 * Energy over time reads as power: Wh/h is W, kWh/h kW, MWh/h MW.
 *
 * Charts that load history themselves get the same transform through `seriesTransform` in
 * chart/frame.ts: box plot, candlestick and the 24-hour clock's number rings. The climate chart
 * (a thermostat's attributes, drawn against its set point) and the wind rose (speeds sorted into
 * bands by direction) have no use for a rate of change and ignore it.
